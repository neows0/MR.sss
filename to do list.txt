Alan, this is just a note to myself on what I need to do

break player class into two parts, human class and player class

room 
-make it be able to be created without a player
-change the room render so that it takes a player and renders around that player specific player

game
-take out the window and put that into the player class

Human/items
-cause rendering of equipped items to happen before or after human depending on where the item is

should each player be on a different thread?
research how listeners work
